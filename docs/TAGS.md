Identifying Landmarks and Tags
==============================

Here we demonstrate one specific capability of Azure Computer Vision
cognitive service, tagging photos, as exposed through the
[MLHub](https://mlhub.ai) package
[azcv](https://github.com/Azure/azcv).

Here are a few examples of identifying landmarks and tagging
images.

A key benefit from using command line tools is that each task can be
wrapped up into other pipelines. Simply place a shell for loop around
the command and we can operate on a folder of images or indeed, a disk
of images.

*ToDo* Some command line use cases in the pipeline include analysing a
photo to add tags and the primary landmarks as meta-data to the image
itself.
